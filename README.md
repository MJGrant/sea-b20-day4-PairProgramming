To use: enter a domain ('http://domain.com') and click the TLD radio buttons to preview how it might look in Google's search results with different TLDs. Perhaps the beginnings of a tool that helps people decide which TLD looks best for their brand? 

Created by John Fahey and Mandi Grant as a pair programming exercise in a new node package - completed August 12th, 2014.
